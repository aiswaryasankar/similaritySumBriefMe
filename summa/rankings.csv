Particularly irking the New York Democrat seemed to be Pence’s reference to her by her widely used nickname “AOC.”

“For the record @Mike_Pence, it’s Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to you,” Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter.

Ocasio-Cortez also appeared bothered by what she saw as “gender dynamics” at work during the debate, in which Pence was the only male participant. She accused Pence of demanding answers for the questions he posed to Harris, while trying to avoid directly answering questions put to him by the debate moderator, Susan Page of USA Today.

“Why is it that Mike Pence doesn’t seem to have to answer any of the questions asked of him in this debate?” she wrote.

BIDEN SAYS HE DOESN'T SUPPORT GREEN NEW DEAL BUT HIS CAMPAIGN WEBSITE CALLS IT 'CRUCIAL FRAMEWORK'

“Pence demanding that Harris answer *his* own personal questions when he won’t even answer the moderator’s is gross, and exemplary of the gender dynamics so many women have to deal with at work,” she added.

But perhaps the most touchy subject for Ocasio-Cortez – a member of so-called “Squad” of far-left lawmakers on Capitol Hill -- was climate change.

During the debate, Pence had suggested that the Green New Deal – the signature legislative proposal of Ocasio-Cortez – was a product of “climate alarmists” that would be expensive and cost many Americans their jobs. Estimates have placed the deal's price tag at more than $90 trillion.

Pence claimed that the Democratic presidential ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and Harris would fully embrace the plan if elected.

“Now, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris climate accord, they’d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes, and literally crush American jobs,” Pence said.

Ocasio-Cortez responded by claiming the Green New Deal ""has been lied about nonstop.""

""It's a massive job-creation and infrastructure plan to decarbonize & increase quality of work and life,"" she wrote.

The vice president also accused Biden and Harris of wanting to steer the U.S. away from traditional energy sources and ban fracking – a process that has helped contribute to the nation’s resurgence in the energy sector but has been a divisive topic among Democrats, who are split between the economic benefits of the process and what many see as its potentially harmful environmental impact.

Harris quickly shot down Pence’s assertion about fracking.

REP. ERIC SWALWELL: AT VP DEBATE, HARRIS EXPOSES TRUMP AS IRRESPONSIBLE, DIVISIVE AND DANGEROUS

The candidates’ ideological differences were clear. They were for the most part presented in a meaningful way that was arguably absent from the first presidential debate, which was mostly taken up with personal attacks.

However, the Wednesday debate — like most vice-presidential debates historically — likely will not impact polls, change any attitudes, cause either campaign to gain or lose any votes, or move any undecided voters one way or the other.

This is especially true because this debate in particular lacked any meaningful policy discussion between the candidates beyond echoing previously articulated policy positions.

Both Pence and Harris dodged difficult questions and pivoted to rehearsed answers or topics of their choice.

As I result, in my view the night was a draw on both substance and style.

In terms of substance, Harris was particularly strong in the first 25 minutes during the coronavirus-focused segment. She leveled sharp criticisms against Pence for the Trump administration’s generally poor handling of the pandemic, and took aim at the administration’s response in light of the damning revelations in Bob Woodward’s latest book that Trump admitted purposefully downplaying the threat of the virus.

“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any president in the history of our country,” Harris said. “They knew what was happening and they didn’t tell you. They knew and they covered it up.”

However, Harris also clearly avoided answering difficult questions about controversial topics —including the Biden-Harris ticket’s position on the Green New Deal, and most notably Harris’ non-answer to Pence’s question on whether she and Biden would “pack the courts” with liberal justices.

Like Harris, Pence had strong substantive moments — particularly during the tax-policy focused segment, where Pence did exactly what Donald Trump failed to do in last week’s debate: draw a meaningful contrast between Biden and Trump on taxes, and hammer home the point that a Biden administration will raise Americans’ taxes.

“America, you just heard Sen. Harris tell you, one Day One Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes,” Pence said, warning that Biden and Harris promised to repeal the Trump tax cuts.

Harris responded that Biden would not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 annually.

Similar to Harris, Pence evaded answering questions on contentious subjects. These included the president’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and most notably, on a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion.

In terms of style, it is arguable that both candidates’ performances were exactly what members of their party hoped for.

Harris focused on attacking Trump and highlighting his administration’s failures — in her words, “prosecuting the case against Donald Trump.”

Democrats will likely laud her performance as strong, given that Harris attacked Trump in a way that was effective and resonated several times throughout the night.

However, Harris’ delivery was similar to Biden’s in last week’s debate — meaning that while both Biden’s and Harris’ performances did no harm, they were inconsequential in the sense that they did nothing to project leadership.

Similarly, Republicans will likely praise Pence’s performance as strong, commanding and a clear display of leadership.

However, Pence at several instances talked over and interrupted Harris, as well as moderator Susan Page of USA Today, prompting Page at one point to pause and remind the vice president that his campaign had agreed to a set of speaking rules for the debate.

Taken together with Pence’s waffling on abortion rights and the Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision that barred states from outlawing abortion, the night likely did not bode well for the Trump-Pence ticket among suburban female voters — a bloc that Republicans are struggling to gain ground with.

Ultimately, given that Pence and Harris dodged difficult questions and largely stuck to previously articulated positions and attacks, the goal for the night on both sides was clearly to do no harm and to avoid any controversial moments. By this measure, both candidates were largely successful.

What were the main takeaways?

Harris hit her goals

The Democratic ticket has a significant polling lead, so a draw with Pence and an avoidance of major errors would have been fine for Harris.

She did better than that.

In the debate’s opening minutes, she was excoriating the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, describing it as “the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.”

She landed punches on other topics, too, including health care, Trump’s alleged disparagement of members of the military and the president’s finances.

Referring to recent disclosures that Trump has significant debt, she said: “It would be really good to know who the president of the United States, the commander in chief, owes money to, because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president’s decisions.”

It wasn’t a perfect performance. Harris blatantly dodged the question of whether she and Biden planned to pack the Supreme Court if Trump succeeds in confirming Judge Amy Coney Barrett, a favorite of conservatives, to the bench.

But, overall, Harris scored a win, when all she needed was to avoid a clear defeat.

Pence did his job

The vice president is an infinitely more orthodox politician than Trump, and he showed this yet again on Wednesday evening.

A former radio talk show host, Pence is an effective debater who is almost impossible to rattle — something that he proved four years ago in his one debate with Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonChance the Rapper, Demi Lovato to play digital concert to encourage voting New York Times editorial board endorses Biden The Hill's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump resumes maskless COVID-19 recovery at White House MORE’s running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineSenate leaves town for two weeks amid coronavirus outbreak This week: Coronavirus complicates Senate's Supreme Court fight Sen. Ron Johnson tests positive for coronavirus MORE (D-Va.).

He was especially effective on Wednesday in making the case for the Trump economy. He did so in a more persuasive and measured way than Trump himself usually does. Pence can also display some degree of empathy, another Trump weak spot.

The vice president took some heat on social media for going over his time limits and for interrupting Harris at times. But he also avoided major mishaps and sometimes pushed Harris back on the defensive.

It was, in short, a proficient performance — but one unlikely to win new converts for a ticket that badly needs them.

Whole lotta dodging going on

The two candidates dodged a lot of questions and did not really face any significant ramifications for doing so.

Examples were numerous. One came when Pence was asked about the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He answered by discussing his pro-life credentials and asking whether Biden and Harris would pack the Supreme Court. Harris, in turn, ducked that question.

The vice president, in particular, skated away from a number of other questions, including whether the American public deserved more transparency around Trump’s health, and what he would if Trump does not commit to a peaceful transfer of power.

The debate moderator, Susan Page, faced criticism for not doing more to tie the candidates down to firm answers.

The fly won

There was no question about the most viral moment of the night.

In the debate’s later stages, a fly landed on Pence’s head, staying there for some time. The vice president did not react — but Twitter did.

Several accounts purporting to voice the fly’s thoughts sprung up immediately.

The Biden team tweeted out a photo of the former vice president armed with a swatter, along with a request for donations. Democrats also appeared to register the internet address “flywillvote.com,"" from which readers were redirected to a Democratic National Committee page encouraging people to register to vote.

The fly provide some light relief in a pretty dark campaign.

The fact that it was one of the most interesting features of Wednesday night’s debate underlined how relatively mundane this clash was, especially compared to last week’s Trump-Biden pyrotechnics.

No game changer

Wednesday night saw a standard, high-level political debate. Neither candidate scored a knock-out. Neither committed a career-defining gaffe.

The end result, then, is likely to be negligible in a race defined by big issues, including the pandemic, the economy and Trump’s tumultuous character.

Democrats benefit from the shape of the race remaining unchanged.
